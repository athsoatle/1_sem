And steale dead seeing of his liuing hew?
Me from my selfe thy cruell eye hath taken,
O know sweet loue I alwaies write of you,
And like vnlettered clarke still crie Amen,
Which die for goodnes, who haue liu’d for crime.
Shakespeare: Sonnets 67: Ah wherefore with infection should he liue
Thy selfe away, are present still with me,
The bountious largesse giuen thee to giue?
Potions of Eysell gainst my strong infection,
Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.
Still loosing when I saw my selfe to win?
Could make me any summers story tell:
So long as men can breath or eyes can see,
But you like none, none you for constant heart.
Louing offendors thus I will excuse yee,
Is but the seemely rayment of my heart,
Shakespeare: Sonnets 41: Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
And steale dead seeing of his liuing hew?
But reckening time, whose milliond accidents
Or whether doth my minde being crown’d with you
Shakespeare: Sonnets 40: Take all my loues, my loue, yea take them all
28: How can I then returne in happy plight
I will not prayse that purpose not to sell.
When thou shalt be disposde to set me light,
And tender chorle makst wast in niggarding:
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change,
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
The hardest knife ill vs’d doth loose his edge.
As an vnperfect actor on the stage,
When lofty trees I see barren of leaues,
Or some fierce thing repleat with too much rage,
Deuouring time blunt thou the Lyons pawes,
Shakespeare: Sonnets 42: That thou hast her is not all my griefe
Saue that to dye, I leaue my loue alone.
Come daily to the banckes, that when they see:
I’st not ynough to torture me alone,
20: A womans face with natures owne hand painted
So far from variation or quicke change?
With mine owne weakenesse being best acquainted,
And your true rights be termd a Poets rage,
